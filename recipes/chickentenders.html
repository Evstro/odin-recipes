        <h1>Keto Chicken Tenders Recipe</h1>

        <p>There are multiple ways you can do keto breading, from almond flour to coconut flour to pork rinds, but my favorite low carb breading for keto chicken strips is this combo of pork rinds and protein powder. It gets super crispy on the outside and sticks well, while the inside stays juicy. Perfection.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Avocado Oil Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 1/2 oz Pork Rinds (crushed)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Collagen Protein Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Paprika</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs Chicken Breasts (cut into 12 strips)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and grease with any fat of your choice.</li>
            <li>Set up two shallow medium bowls: place the mayonnaise in one and in the other stir together the pork rinds, whey protein powder, garlic powder, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Toss the chicken strips in the bowl with the mayonnaise. Take a chicken strip from the bowl and remove any excess mayonnaise. Use the other hand to press the chicken into the breading mixture and scoop more breading over the top, submerging the chicken strip to coat on all sides. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken strips.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until just barely cooked through.</li>
            <li>Turn on the broiler. Place the chicken strips under the broiler for 1-2 minutes to crisp up more.</li>
        </ol>
